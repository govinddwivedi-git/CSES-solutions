# CSES Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/), a collection of competitive programming practice problems.

## Structure

Each file is named after the corresponding problem and contains a C++ solution.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run any solution:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall <filename> -o solution
./solution
```

## Algorithms and Techniques

The solutions use various algorithms and techniques:
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Bit Manipulation
- Sorting and Searching
- Graph Algorithms
- Mathematics

## Contributing

Feel free to suggest optimizations or alternative solutions by opening an issue or pull request.
